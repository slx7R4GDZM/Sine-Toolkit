add
	configuration gui
	support for non kb input
	vector monitor shader
	cmake file

re-do correctly
	a lot of the code, there's so much code duplication, this could probably be done in a few hundred less lines
	vector generator
	fix fps limiter being slightly off from 60
	replace pragma onces with include guards and get rid of other non-standard stuff like case ranges
	get rid of passing window and vectorgenerator to everything
